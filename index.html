                <h2 class="font-gray thin">ABOUT</h2>
                <p class="font-gray">
                    The University of New Brunswick was late to the game in establishing a varsity sailing team. Dalhousie, Memorial and other
                    universities in the region have had sailing teams for years, but the UNB Sailing Team was New Brunwickâ€™s first and only student-run
                    university sailing team. The UNB sailing team is comprised of students with a wide range of experience levels and background. And
                    the team has only experienced upwards growth since its inception.
                </p>
                <p class="font-gray">
                    Todd and Cody shared a similar vision for the team even before its inception in September 2017. The initial vision for the team was
                    to get students on the water. A core group of 8 sailors was established who trained and competed regularly, along with a team of
                    executives to help lead them. In March of 2018, we received provisional status as a CICSA team, allowing us to compete against
                    other Canadian universities.
                </p>
                <p class="font-gray">
                    Our future vision for the team is to establish a permanent dinghy training facility on the grounds of the Fredericton Yacht Club on
                    Lincoln Road in the form of recycled shipping containers to promote sustainability and to further our recruitment initiatives to
                    foster a recurring talent pool at the university.
                </p>
                <p class="font-gray">
                    The continuous growth of the team relies on interest from students at UNB. We are looking for enthusiastic students
                    who are keen to learn and willing to invest their time to learn the ropes. We accept anyone and everyone, regardless of
                    experience level, whether interested in leisure or competition sailing.
                </p>
                <p class="font-gray">
                    The UNB Sailing team is a provisional member of Canadian Intercollegiate Sailing Association (CISCA). The team is partnered with
                    the Mactaquac Sailing Association and the Fredericton Yacht Club. The team is also partners with the Fredericton Small Craft
                    And Aquatic Centre.
                </p>
                <h4 class="font-gray thin">Events and Practice</h4>
                <p class="font-gray">
                    A typical week in the sailing season may include 420 training downtown, 1-2 keel boat races at either Mactaquac or Douglas
                    Harbour and the potential of a CICSA event. The off-season focus shifts to classroom sessions and physical fitness ensuring
                    a productive schedule year-round. Interesting and unique events such as trips and other opportunities are always lurking
                    in the background as well.
                </p>
                <p class="font-gray">
                    Opportunities are currently underway and fast approaching. It is recommended in order to get the most of this experience,
                    to start attending occasions such as sails and meetings posted in the group.
                </p>
                <h4 class="font-gray thin">Socials</h4>
                <p class="font-gray">
                    Sailing is so much fun, but one of the biggest reasons the team exists is to bring together students from UNB who share a passion.
                    This is the perfect chance to meet amazing people and form connections and friendships for years to come.
                </p>
                <p class="font-gray">
                    Every year, the team organizes several social events, which includes ski trips, a Christmas party, socials, and visits to the local
                    microbreweries in the area.

                                Cody Morris grew up sailing in New Brunswick at the Shediac Bay Sailing School and has sailed countless different classes of boats and has competed in the C420, Laser,
                                One-Design and PHRF classes. At the age of 16 he became a CYA White Sail instructor and later obtained CANSail 3-4 and 5-6 instructor certifications. Cody is currently
                                still very active in keelboat racing as the President of Sail New Brunswick. He is also a Sail Canada Learning Facilitator, meaning he evaluates and certifies new and
                                existing coaches across the country during his spare time from being a Civil Engineer.

                                    Prior to joining the UNB Sailing Team, I had roughly two years of casual keelboat sailing experience. The whole

                    We need help.
                </p>
				<p class="font-gray">
                    We receive limited funding from the university and community, and as a result it is difficult to arrange travel for students
                    who wish to compete in intercollegiate sailing competitions. We also rely on membership fees to fund the rental of dinghy boats
                    for training, which can be a significant cost for students. Donations and support from the community help keep the team sustainable
                    and able to introduce students to the world of sailing.
                </p>
				<p class="font-gray">
                    All help is welcomed. We are looking to work with local businesses to form sponsorships through brand promotion. We are also seeking
                    donations of any kind, such as monetary donations or the provision of sailing gear and equipment. If interested, please contact
